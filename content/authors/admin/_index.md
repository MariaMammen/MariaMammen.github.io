From 2019 - 2023 I worked as a project coordinator, lecturer and postdoctoral researcher in developmental psychology at the [Social Development Lab](https://www.socialdevlab.org/) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich, Germany. 

As a researcher, my focus is on **understanding how children learn about rules, norms and values in their interactions with the people around them**. Specifically, I explore how preschool children discuss moral issues with their friends and their parents, and how these interactions shape their moral development.

As a lecturer, **I thrive to inspire the next generation of researchers** by mentoring undergrad and postgrad students and overseeing Bachelor's and Master's theses in psychology and pedagogy. I'm also a dedicated teacher of undergraduate courses that cover the foundations of academic research, writing, and consultation skills.

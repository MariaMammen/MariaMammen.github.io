abstract: Moral reasoning is a central aspect of morality, and its acquisition is therefore a central aspect of moral development. Children acquire moral norms through social interactions with others. Yet, the moral reasoning process that subserves the appreciation of norms remains vastly understudied. In this article we present a theoretical framework on the nature of moral development that conceives human morality in terms of communication. Following this framework, we argue for a closer, systematic investigation of children’s moral reasoning that complements the predominant approach of adult-led interviews examining children’s moral judgments. To better understand the role of the reasoning process for moral development, we need to investigate how different reasoning partners and individual differences influence this process. Ultimately, giving moral reasoning the much-deserved attention has the potential to broaden our understanding of how children become moral beings and how human morality is constituted.
